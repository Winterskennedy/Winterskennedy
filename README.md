# Hi there ♡\~🎧 My name is Autumn ໒꒰ྀིᵔ ᵕ ᵔ ꒱ྀི১ and I'm learning how to code in my class :)🌸 I'm a sophomore and I love horror games and cute things.🐇
I'm trying to get better at coding so I can make games for my younger brothers. However, I don't plan on going into the coding field because I like creating art more. 🎀🖋
My favorite types of candies are gummies and fruit-flavored ice creams.  ପ꒰ ˶• ༝ •˶꒱ଓ 🌸🤍 I have no clue how to code. Making a horror game is my current goal. ૮ ˙Ⱉ˙ ა rawr!
